# p5-typescript-react-starter

The aim of this repo is to quickstart your p5/react project by skipping the configuration part.

This package bundles:
- p5.js
- React (via create-react-app)
- Typescript
- EsLint (with airbnb config)

It provides boilerplate code that handles rendering and passing the data to and fro.
The demo is included as default code and will show up after boot up of the project.

You can change how Typescript behaves via ```tsconfig.json```. It defaults to quite strict rules that make JS feel more like low level language.
